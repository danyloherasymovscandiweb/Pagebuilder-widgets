# Pagebuilder-widgets
Collection of widgets and content-types for Magento Pagebuilder (for ScandiPWA ONLY!)

This repository consists of collection of various blocks, to use as a base for future implementations. These parts of codes are implemented as widgets and conent-types - blocks, which can be set up and adjusted via CMS admin panel with little or no coding involved.

Both widgets and content-types are Magento extensions for creating content by dragging-and-dropping pre-built blocks of code. With little adjustments that reuires no coding, a user can simply add a necessary block and configure it with relevant data (texts, images, colors, links, etc). The main difference between the 2 is that content-type allow preview of the component in the admin panel, as well as live-editing features. They are harder to implement, too.

The folders inside this repo will represent various blocks both available as widgets and as content-types. Each folder will have it's own readme file, explaining main settings and implementations of this block, as well as providing graphic examples. If a developer wants to proceed with a certain block, they should follow further into the "Implementation" folder, which will consist of code they'll have to add to their project, as well as instruction on how to do that.

For project-specific goals and implementation of unique features, the styles, logic and other parts of the widget/content-type may be changed. They are made primarily in order to increase code re-usability inside among SW projects, as many of the projects we work on now and may work on in feature are likely to have common needs and require common solutions. Widgets and content-types allow developers who are looking to implement a particular block to choose ready-made solution, that can perfectly satisfy their project's needs with little adjustments.
