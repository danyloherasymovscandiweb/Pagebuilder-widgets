# Pagebuilder-content-types
Collection of content-types for SW Pagebuilder (for ScandiPWA ONLY!)

This repository consists of collection of various blocks, to use as a base for future implementations. These parts of codes are implemented as widgets and conent-types - blocks, which can be set up and adjusted via CMS admin panel with little or no coding involved.

For project-specific goals and implementation of unique features, the styles, logic and other parts of the content-type may be changed. They are made primarily in order to increase code re-usability inside among SW projects, as many of the projects we work on now and may work on in feature are likely to have common needs and require common solutions. Widgets allow developers who are looking to implement a particular block to choose ready-made solution, that can perfectly satisfy their project's needs with little adjustments.

The folders inside this repo will represent various CMS blocks. Each folder will have it's own readme file, explaining main settings and implementations of this block, as well as providing graphic examples. If a developer wants to proceed with a certain block, they should follow further into the "Implementation" folder, which will consist of code they'll have to add to their project, as well as instruction on how to do that.

This repository contains following content-types ready to use:
